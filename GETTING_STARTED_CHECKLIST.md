# Getting Started Checklist

Use this checklist to publish your package to GitHub and optionally PyPI.

## ‚úÖ Pre-Publication Checklist

### 1. Update Package Information
- [ ] Open `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Update author name and email:
  ```toml
  authors = [
      {name = "Your Name", email = "your.email@example.com"}
  ]
  ```
- [ ] You'll update URLs after creating GitHub repo (see below)

### 2. Test Locally
- [ ] Open terminal in project directory
- [ ] Install in development mode: `pip install -e .`
- [ ] Test the CLI: `bridge-ingest --help`
- [ ] Run tests (optional): `pytest`

### 3. Review .gitignore
- [ ] Check that `.gitignore` excludes output directories
- [ ] Verify it excludes `__pycache__` and `.pyc` files
- [ ] Make sure no sensitive data will be committed

## üì§ Publishing to GitHub

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
- [ ] Go to https://github.com/new
- [ ] Repository name: `bridge-deals-ingest` (or your choice)
- [ ] Description: "A comprehensive tool for ingesting and analyzing bridge game data"
- [ ] Choose **Public** (for open source) or **Private**
- [ ] **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (you already have one)
- [ ] Click "Create repository"
- [ ] **Copy the repository URL** (e.g., `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bridge-deals-ingest.git`)

### Step 2: Update URLs in pyproject.toml
- [ ] Open `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username in these lines:
  ```toml
  [project.urls]
  Homepage = "https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bridge-deals-ingest"
  Repository = "https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bridge-deals-ingest"
  Issues = "https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bridge-deals-ingest/issues"
  ```

### Step 3: Initialize Git (if not already done)
In your terminal:
```bash
# Check if git is initialized
git status

# If not initialized, run:
git init
```

### Step 4: Stage and Commit Files
```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Initial commit: Package structure and documentation"
```

### Step 5: Push to GitHub
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username:
```bash
# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bridge-deals-ingest.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 6: Verify on GitHub
- [ ] Go to your repository URL
- [ ] Verify all files are there
- [ ] Check that README.md displays nicely
- [ ] Verify `.gitignore` is working (no `__pycache__`, output folders, etc.)

### Step 7: Create First Release
- [ ] Go to your repository on GitHub
- [ ] Click "Releases" (right sidebar)
- [ ] Click "Create a new release"
- [ ] Tag version: `v0.1.0`
- [ ] Release title: `v0.1.0 - Initial Release`
- [ ] Description: Copy relevant sections from `CHANGELOG.md`
- [ ] Click "Publish release"

## üéâ Done! Your Package is on GitHub!

Users can now install it with:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bridge-deals-ingest.git
```

## üì¶ Optional: Publishing to PyPI

Only do this if you want to publish to the Python Package Index (PyPI).

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Install build tools: `pip install build twine`
- [ ] Create PyPI account: https://pypi.org/account/register/
- [ ] Generate API token: https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/

### Build Package
```bash
# Clean previous builds
rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info

# Build
python -m build

# Check
twine check dist/*
```

### Test on TestPyPI (Recommended)
```bash
# Upload to test PyPI
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Test install
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ bridge-deals-ingest
```

### Publish to PyPI
```bash
# Upload to PyPI
twine upload dist/*
```

Now users can install with simply:
```bash
pip install bridge-deals-ingest
```

## üîÑ Making Updates Later

### For Code Changes:
1. Make your changes
2. Update version in `pyproject.toml` (e.g., 0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.1.1)
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
4. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update: Description of changes"
   git push
   ```
5. Create new release on GitHub
6. If published to PyPI, rebuild and upload:
   ```bash
   python -m build
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

## üìù Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Local development
pip install -e .              # Install in development mode

git push                      # Push to GitHub

# Package building
python -m build              # Build package
twine check dist/*           # Verify build
twine upload dist/*          # Upload to PyPI

# Installation testing
