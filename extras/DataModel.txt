Errors seen while processing VuGraph files:
* board_name should start with 'o' or 'c', but sometimes just has the board number.
This happens for some test  vugraphs. We can either drop these boards or do some hack 
* Hands info (md tag) is empty in some files. Again, can either drop these boards or keep hand blank
